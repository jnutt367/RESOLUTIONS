## ğŸ‘‹  Hello and Thanks for viewing! RESOLUTIONS is a family affair animated SVG project.

#### A wizard my brother Brian and I had been planning on working to animate! Now it's DONE.
### First Brian created this beautiful SVG and sent it to me in an adobe illustrator file.ğŸŒ± (as a one piece grouped SVG)
- ğŸŒ±  Then. I took the file from Adobe Illustrator and exported it as an SVG. 
- ğŸŒ±  I opened VSCode and the terminal and ran the command `mkdir Resolutions` and then the command `cd Resolutions`
- ğŸŒ±  Next, I created a repository in github called jnutt367/Resolutions and inside the VSCode terminal had git initialize it for me with `git init`
- ğŸŒ± I followed the new repository from the command line instructions to the letter

- ğŸŒ±  After that, I created the index.html file for the project. And embedded the SVG as one document inside the HTML page.
- - ğŸŒ±  Ran the cmd `git add *` `git commit -m "first commit"` and then `git push -u`
- From there on any changes rewuire a `git add *` a `git commit -m "  "` and a `git push -u` to push the changes to github...
- ğŸŒ±  Now comes the fun part!!..Grouping all relative components in order to grab them for animations.
- ğŸŒ± Then I embedded the gsap3 script tag and the gsap3 file script tag
- ğŸŒ± Made a detailed Mockup and story boarded out how the animations should be ordered. 
- ğŸŒ± Implemented said animation through trials and tesing out different timelines in gsap3.
- ğŸŒ± Hosted and deployed with vercel
