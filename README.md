# RESOLUTIONS

## That wizard Brian and I have been planning on working to animate! 
### First Brian created this beautiful SVG and sent it to me in an adobe illustrator file.
### Then. I took the file from Adobe Illustrator and exported it as an SVG. 
### I opened VSCode and the terminal and ran the command `mkdir Resolutions` and then the command `cd Resolutions`
## Next, I created a repository in github called jnutt367/Resolutions and inside the VSCode terminal had git initialize it for me.
### After that, I created the index.html file for the project. And embedded the SVG as one document inside the HTML page.
## Now comes the fun part!!..Grouping all relative components in order to grab them for animations.
