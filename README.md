## Hello and Thanks for viewing! RESOLUTIONS is a family affair animated SVG project.

#### A wizard my brother Brian and I had been planning on working to animate! Now it's DONE.
### First Brian created this beautiful SVG and sent it to me in an adobe illustrator file.🌱 (as a one piece grouped SVG)
🌱  Then. I took the file from Adobe Illustrator and exported it as an SVG. 
🌱  I opened VSCode and the terminal and ran the command `mkdir Resolutions` and then the command `cd Resolutions`
🌱  Next, I created a repository in github called jnutt367/Resolutions and inside the VSCode terminal had git initialize it for me.
🌱  After that, I created the index.html file for the project. And embedded the SVG as one document inside the HTML page.
🌱  Now comes the fun part!!..Grouping all relative components in order to grab them for animations.
- 🌱 Then I embedded the gsap3 script tag and the gsap3 file script tag
- 🌱 Made a detailed Mockup and story boarded out how the animations should be ordered. 
- 🌱 Implemented said animation through trials and tesing out different timelines in gsap3.
- 🌱 Hosted and deployed with vercel
- 💬 Ask me about ...How fun it is to animate stuff?
